## Specification

_Specification overview_: 
- implement a node that sends the parking slot occupancy;
- ESP32 and HC-SR04 must be used.

Project specifications in full are in the file: *[Specification](https://github.com/AlessandroConti11/Parking_Occupancy/blob/main/Specification.pdf)*.


## How to run

The node was implemented using the Wokwi platform to simulate its operation. 

The ESP32 board and the HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensor was used to implement the node.

To try it out, you can copy and paste the [diagram.json](https://github.com/AlessandroConti11/Parking_Occupancy/blob/main/diagram.json) and [sketch.ino](https://github.com/AlessandroConti11/Parking_Occupancy/blob/main/sketch.ino) files on the [Wokwi site](https://wokwi.com/) and run the simulation or follow the following [link](https://wokwi.com/projects/392079840139555841) where the implementation is already present.


## Final consideration

In the *[Report](https://github.com/AlessandroConti11/Parking_Occupancy/blob/main/Report.pdf)* we find the final considerations, node consumption, and ideas for increasing its lifetime.
